## Part 1 – Structure & Content
I created four pages for my site: **Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact**.  
Each page uses proper semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.  
- The **About Me** page has my photo, a short bio, and a 45–60 second video with controls and a poster.  
- The **Projects** page highlights four different projects I’ve done.  
- The **Contact** page includes a form with Name, Email, Cell, and Comments fields.  
All pages share the same navigation bar and footer (with my name, email, and phone number).

## Part 2 – GUI/Interface
I made the site responsive without flexbox by creating three separate CSS files:  
- `style.css` for laptops/desktops (default)  
- `tablet.css` for screens between 600px–1024px  
- `mobile.css` for screens up to 599px  

For design, I used CSS variables to keep a consistent color scheme. My palette was created in Adobe Color:  
**Palette link:** [insert your Adobe Color link here].  

I also used gradients:  
- A linear gradient for the header background.  
- An angled gradient (135°) on highlight sections, like the intro on the Home page and the last project on the Projects page.

## Part 3 – Testing & Validation
- **HTML Validation:** I tested each page with the W3C HTML validator and resolved errors.  
- **CSS Validation:** I ran all three CSS files through the W3C CSS validator.  
- **Links:** Verified using the W3C Link Checker after deployment; all links and media worked.  
- **Spell Check:** Used VS Code spell checker and manual reading to fix any mistakes.  
- **Accessibility:** Added a “Skip to main content” link at the top of every page and ensured all images have alt text. I also added visible keyboard focus outlines. Tested the site with WAVE; no errors reported.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates semantic HTML, responsive design, gradients, accessibility, and testing. All requirements for Parts 1–3 are complete.
